The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a Command Module with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a Service Module, which supported the Command Module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a Lunar Module for landing on the Moon. After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. After lifting off in the upper part of the Lunar Module and rejoining Collins in the Command Module, they returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.
